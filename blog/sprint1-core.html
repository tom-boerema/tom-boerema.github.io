                          <li>integrity</li>

                        <p>I value people who are honest and can be direct when communicating with other poeple. Many problems in the world are due to poor communication. 
                          <br><br>
                        People who are ambitious inspire me. I think surrounding yourself with people who will push you to be a better person is one of life's secrets. Motivation can be fleeting but being disciplined and determined are not. Ambition drives change, new ideas and reform. 
                        <br><br>
                        I have a strong passion for being efficient and not wasting time. Life is short and when you are young, opportunity is everywhere, often without consequences as obligations come later in life. I also have to be aware to be present though and enjoy life's moments. 
                        <br><br>
                        Being reliable is important to me as it's a form of respect. It is especially great when it's mutual. 
                        <br><br>
                        The world is a better place when people are nice and have kind intentions.

                      I grew up in Australia and my heritage is Dutch, which has had a fairly strong influence in my opinions, values and personality. My family travelled a lot when I was young which gave me persepective which I think is valuable and gives me appreciation for when I have.

              I am generally a fast learner. I tend to prefer teaching myself and watching someone who is more experienced but I appreciate teachers in providing a learning structure and accountability. We are the most fortunate generation that has ever lived and you can learn almost anything using the internet. A few skills I have learnt using the internet include training and breaking in horses, video editing, playing guitar and producing electronic music. As technology progresses, the entry level of many skills decreases. This makes it easier than ever to learn and gain competence in a skill but also means there is more competition. 
              <br> <br>
              
              I replaced limitations with difficulties as limitations imply that you cannot improve in this area, difficulties can develop into strengths if you work hard enough and put in the time. 
              <br><br>
              I struggle sometimes with focus. Not on the micro-level but on the macro-level. I can focus on individual tasks but sometimes I lose direction for the bigger picture. Being self-driven and self-employed, you can sometimes find yourself just doing what you like, rather than what should be done. I also often obsess over details which is incredibly fustrating sometimes.

                      <p>
                        Everyone is different and has strengths and weaknesses. I believe you should play your strengths and work on your weaknesses in your spare time or on individual tasks.  
                        <br><br>
                        Every circumstance is different in a working environment but the best method of reducing tension is through clear communication. Making sure everyone is in agreement at various stages through a task will help with group dynamics significantly. Managing expectations early on is a way to benchmark progress and reach mutual agreement. 
                        <br><br>
                        For example, in software development, establishing early references for the UI, UX and functionality provides a benchmark. This can be revisited at various stages in the project to ensure that quality is adequate. 
                        <br><br>
                        I can sometimes find it difficult to give responsibility to partners or employees if they are not reaching my expectations. I don't mind if they are willing to learn and try depending on the time or place. I think everyone should be open to improvement and be looking for a way to improve their workflow. Working with people who are not familiar with a workflow can be difficult (e.g. working with non-technical people). Often it is better for each person to work in their area of strength, while outside of the task, they work on their weaknesses without pressure. This also how I prefer to be treated.
